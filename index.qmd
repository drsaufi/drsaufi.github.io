I am passionate about **public health**, **epidemiology**, **statistical analysis**, and **public speaking**. I love simplifying complex topics and sharing knowledge through *workshops*, *ebooks*, and *health-related talks*. Whether it is teaching data skills or giving presentations on **public health**, I am always excited to help others understand the world of *health* and *data analysis* better.

When I am not diving deep into *research* or delivering *talks*, you will likely find me exploring the latest *tech trends*, *writing*, or *brainstorming* new ways to make learning fun and accessible.

Feel free to explore! Head to the About section to learn more about me, Services to see how I can help with consultations or collaborations, and Contact to reach out for any offers or partnerships.
