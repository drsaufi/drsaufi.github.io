I am passionate about **public health**, **epidemiology**, **statistical analysis**, and **public speaking**. I love simplifying complex topics and sharing knowledge through *workshops*, *ebooks*, and *health-related talks*. 

Whether it is teaching data skills or giving presentations on **public health**, I am always excited to help others understand the world of *health* and *data analysis* better.

Feel free to explore and learn more about my work! Do not hesitate to reach out for consultations or collaborations.
